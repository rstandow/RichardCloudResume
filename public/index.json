[{"categories":null,"contents":" What is a Cloud Resume? The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as an AWS Cloud Engineer. the project was first published by Forrest Brazeal. who works at A Cloud Guru, a cloud education company. Linkdin\nHere are the steps I took with a breakdown\nCertification\nI have finished the AWS training for Practitioners, and Solutions Architect. I will wait until I am back in the US to take the test, which should be Nov or Dec 2022.\nHTML\nCSS\nFor section two and three I decided to learn a markdown compiler called Hugo to challenge myself and see how well it generates CSS files. It has been a journey learning Hugo and seeing what it can do. I am still working on image processing for this static site. This has been a bit more tricker than I thought it would be.\nStatic Website\nThis resume site is a static site hosted on S3 container with its www counterpart also on S3 container pointing to the root domain S3 container also kept the www as a failover if needed. I also created a dynamic site, the root domain of this one https://www.hitechmadeez.com that uses WordPress. I had setup an entire network based on the diagram but the cost of running EC2 and license I turned if off.I moved the site to cheap cloud hosting provider. You can see more information on what I did here HiTechMadeEZ Project\nHTTPS\nThis site is secured with CloudFront SSL certificate issued from AWS.\nDNS\nI was using route 53 and may move back over right now I am using the DNS provided by my new hosting company. I may move back to route 53 when I have the funds to pay for the cloud projects.\nJavaScript\nThis is my weak area I am having displaying issues with my counter.\nDatabase\nThis site using DynamoDB for counter and few other things\nWordPress site is on MySQL\nAPI Using AWS Rest HTTP Gateway with a lambda trigger to increment the page counter.\nI will be honest java is my weak area I have all the connections working its just the display format. When it renders the result, it clears all the formatting here and I am trying to figure out why. With moving back to the US, I am super busy. So, I have just made a call with another API\nVisits to this page ...\rHere is my Java that makes the AWS call that is displaying incorrectly. Git Repo With Page Counter\nPython Not a whole lot of Python is used on this project except the lambda function that calls the DynamoDB. I do plan on adding more later.\nTests All throughout this project I developed dev environments and conducted tests to ensure the code worked. I use CloudWatch for various segments to monitor errors and downtime. I am using CloudFront Health check and another outside party to monitor this site.\nInfrastructure as Code I am still learning all the services of AWS and how they interact with each other. I found it difficult to write code in Json or Yaml without exploring what service did what and found it easier to use GUI to get an idea on how they worked together.\nSource Control I am using Visual Studio and uploading to git for source control. I have the S3 buckets versioning turned on. I even played with AWS Config service, though I had too many rules after a couple days I turned this off as I was constantly making changes in several areas.\nCI/CD (Back end) I am running GitHub workflow to push from local computer to GitHub then to S3 bucket\nCI/CD (Front end) I will use GitHub with pipeline to push updates to this site\nBlog post\nI created a resume and FAQ page so that people can download my Resume or CV and cover some FAQ questions you may have.\nThankyou for visiting\n","permalink":"https://richard.hitechmadeez.com/projects/creations/cloud-resume-challenge.html","tags":["AWS","CSS","CloudFront","Load Balancer","EC2","S3","WAF","Lambda","Rest API"],"title":"Cloud Resume Challenge"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments.

At first, I used AWS did a full-scale backend. Route 53 as my DNS, load balancer, EC2 LAMP stack then AMI image of Plesk, CloudFront, S3. This allowed me to fulfill these Roles\nFirst Role\nSince WordPress is still the number one website platform used. I wanted to keep my knowledge current on WordPress. To be able answer any questions that my friends or family may have, the other reason was to keep updated on management, security, varies integrations.\nSecond Role No longer current see update below hosting.hitechmadeez.com you will see that is Plesk login. I am running the Plesk application on EC2 AMI Image. This provides an easy-to-use GUI for I and my friends that are hosting their websites with me.\nThird Role\nWhile I am still in AWS 12-month free tier, I can explore and use several AWS services that I would not normally use and put them into practice while trying to stay within a set budget. This will also allow me to work within the AWS Budget explorer and, see how the cost are applied across all the services. I have setup budget and alerts in place to notify me at certain thresholds are met, my average spending is around $100 US for all the services and subscriptions required to provide reliable hosting environment. I have found this very useful in understanding how the services work and what benefits they bring along with the cost.\nUPDATE 24 Sept 2022\nAfter reviewing finances (Moving back to US and the soaring cost) and looking at the time commitment to offer a feature rich but demanding production web hosting environment, the response time (SLA) if anyone had any sort of problems and working a full-time job. I decided to move almost everything to a shared hosting provider. All that is left right now on AWS is S3 containers, this resume site running on S3 and CloudWatch, CloudFront. I learned a lot but in the end time and money forced me to move everything. I am revamping HiTechMadeEZ as I am writing this update ,once I have the site out of development I will append this.\n","permalink":"https://richard.hitechmadeez.com/projects/creations/hitechmadeez-website.html","tags":["EC2","Route53","CloudFront","Membership Website","AWS","Monitoring","OpenAI"],"title":"Hitechmadeez Website"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rFAQ you may have.\rQ: Where are you now?\nA: Until Nov 5th 2022 I currently reside in Hua Hin Thailand.
