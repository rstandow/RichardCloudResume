[{"categories":null,"contents":" As I lack proof of cloud skills working for others, I put this project together to showcase my skills. You may ask \u0026ldquo;What is Cloud Resume Challenge\u0026rdquo;? let me use a bit of Prompt engineering and see what GPT3 says \u0026ldquo;As more and more businesses move to the cloud; they are looking for ways to leverage this new technology to improve their bottom line. One way they are doing this is by challenging their employees to create resumes that are stored in the cloud. The cloud resume challenge is a way for businesses to encourage their employees to create resumes that are stored in the cloud. This way, if an employee leaves the company, their resume is still stored in the cloud and can be accessed by the new employer. This challenge can be used to improve employee retention, as well as to help businesses save money on printing and storing paper resumes. It is also a way to encourage employees to keep their resumes up to date. If you are a business owner or manager, you can encourage your employees to participate in the cloud resume challenge by offering a prize for the best resume. This can be a monetary prize, or it can be something like a free day off. To get started, all you need to do is create a cloud storage account and give your employees access to it. Then, challenge them to create the best resume they can. The sky\u0026rsquo;s the limit!\u0026rdquo; Interesting that GPT3 used the approach of looking at it from an employers point of view. I used this template from this site https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws modified it a bit, by adding more to it and over the time I will add more functionality to this page and hitechmadeez.com.\nHere are the steps I took with a breakdown\nCertification\nI have finished both the AWS training for Practitioners, and Solutions Architect. I will wait until I am back in the US to take the test, which should be Nov or Dec 22.\nHTML\nCSS\nFor section two and three I decided to learn a markdown compiler called Hugo to challenge myself and see how well it generates CSS files. It has been a journey learning Hugo and seeing what it can do.\nStatic Website\nThis resume site is a static site hosted on S3 container with its www counterpart also on S3 container pointing to the root S3 container also kept as failover if needed. I also created a dynamic site, the root domain of this one https://www.hitechmadeez.com that uses Wordpress. This allowed me to practice using WordPress and keeping it secure and up to date and other AWS services S3 bucket for offsite image storage, VPC, Load Balancer, EC2, AMI Image, Snapshots, CloudFront, WAF. I also set up a mail server. I had to set up an SMTP relay since most cloud providers do not allow mail servers without special permission.\nHTTPS\nThis site is secured with CloudFront SSL cert the root domain www is CloudFront cache while dev. and other testing environments that I used a lets encrypt and wildcard for mail and sub domains\nDNS\nThe lamp stack server has its internal DNS for name servers for other sub domains. This and main site are hosted through Route53\nJavaScript\nI have a basic understanding of the syntax of JavaScript. I would not say I am fluent in using it yet. It is on my list of to do though. The visitor counter is making its API call using JavaScript that sends a get through a lambda function that increments the count in DynamoDB.Returns the database value.\nDatabase\nThis site using DynamoDB for counter and few other things\nWordPress site is on MySQL\nAPI Using AWS Rest HTTP Gateway with a lambda trigger to increment the page counter.\nI will be honest java is my weak area I have all the connections working its just the display format. When it renders the result it clears all the formatting here and I am trying to figure out why. With moving back to the US I am super busy. So I have just made a call with another API\nVisits to this page ...\rHere is my Java that makes the AWS call that is displaying incorrectly. Git Repo With Page Counter\nPython Not a whole lot of Python is used on this project except the lambda function that calls the DynamoDB.I do plan on adding more later.\nTests All throughout this project I developed dev environments and conducted tests to ensure the code worked. I use CloudWatch for various segments to monitor errors and downtime.I am using CloudFront Health check and another outside party to monitor this site and others I am hosting for friends and family.\nInfrastructure as Code This area I struggled a bit. As I am still learning all the services of AWS and how they interact with each other. I found it difficult to write code in Json or Yaml without exploring what service did what it wanted using the GUI.\nSource Control I am using Visual Studio and uploading to git for source control. I have the S3 buckets versioning. I even played with AWS Config service, though I had too many rules after a couple days I turned this off as I was constantly making changes in several areas.\nCI/CD (Back end) I am running github workflow to push from local computer to github then to S3 bucket\nCI/CD (Front end) I will use GitHub with pipeline to push updates to this site\nBlog post\nI created a resume and FAQ page so that people can download my Resume or CV and cover some FAQ questions you may have.\nThankyou for visiting\n","permalink":"https://richard.hitechmadeez.com/projects/creations/cloud-resume-challenge.html","tags":["AWS","CSS","CloudFront","Load Balancer","EC2","S3","WAF","Lambda","Rest API"],"title":"Cloud Resume Challenge"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments.

The website has several articles, videos, and other resources that can be used to educate others about various topics related to technology. The website will also have several forums where people can ask questions and get help from others who are more knowledgeable about technology. HiTechMadeEz is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about technology or educate others about it.\nI have gone back and forth if I want to monetize it or not. Right now, to be honest it is a little bit all over the place and plan on making it just Information site to help others. I also plan on getting a few other friends to help with article generation. As of right now though it is serving a couple different roles\nFirst Role\nSince WordPress is still the number one website platform used. I wanted to use it answer questions that my friends always have, the other is keep updated on management, security, varies integrations using it.\nSecond Role\nIf you go to hosting.hitechmadeez.com you will see that is Plesk login. I am running the Plesk application on EC2 AMI Image. This provides an easy-to-use GUI for I and my friends that are hosting their websites with me.\nThird Role\nWhile I am still in AWS 12-month free tier, explore and use AWS services and put them into practice. This does not mean everything is free for me, but I try my best to keep the cost down. I can also see for myself how to explore AWS Budget explorer, see how the cost are applied. I have a budget setup and alerts in place, I average around $100 US. Always looking how to maximize resources to minimalize cost. I have found this very useful in understanding how the services work and what benefits they bring.\nUPDATE 24 Sept 2022\nAfter revieving finaces(Moving back to US and soaring cost) and looking at comitment feature rich but demanding Production web hosting eveiorment. The time required and honesty response time if anyone had any sort of peoblems. I have moved almost everything to Hosted provider.All that is left is S3 containers , this resume site running on S3 and cloudwatch. I learned alot but in the end time and money forced me to move everything. I learned alot and will use AWS for small or personal projects. I am revamping HiTechMadeEZ once it is updated I will change this.\n","permalink":"https://richard.hitechmadeez.com/projects/creations/hitechmadeez-website.html","tags":["EC2","Route53","CloudFront","Membership Website","AWS","Monitoring","OpenAI"],"title":"Hitechmadeez Website"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\rFAQ you may have.\rQ: Where are you now?\nA: Until Nov 5th 2022 I currently reside in Hua Hin Thailand.
