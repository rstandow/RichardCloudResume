      <description>As I lack proof of cloud skills working for others, I put this project together to showcase my skills. You may ask &amp;ldquo;What is Cloud Resume Challenge&amp;rdquo;? let me use a bit of Prompt engineering and see what GPT3 says &amp;ldquo;As more and more businesses move to the cloud; they are looking for ways to leverage this new technology to improve their bottom line. One way they are doing this is by challenging their employees to create resumes that are stored in the cloud.</description>

Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <link>https://richard.hitechmadeez.com/projects/past-projects/shields-docker.html</link>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
