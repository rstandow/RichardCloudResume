As I lack proof of cloud skills working for others I put this together to showcase my skills. You may ask "What is Cloud Resume Challenge"? let me use a bit Prompt engineering and see what GPT3 says "As more and more businesses move to the cloud, they are looking for ways to leverage this new technology to improve their bottom line. One way they are doing this is by challenging their employees to create resumes that are stored in the cloud.
The cloud resume challenge is a way for businesses to encourage their employees to create resumes that are stored in the cloud. This way, if an employee leaves the company, their resume is still stored in the cloud and can be accessed by the new employer.
This challenge can be used as a way to improve employee retention, as well as to help businesses save money on printing and storing paper resumes. It is also a way to encourage employees to keep their resumes up to date.
If you are a business owner or manager, you can encourage your employees to participate in the cloud resume challenge by offering a prize for the best resume. This can be a monetary prize, or it can be something like a free day off.
To get started, all you need to do is create a cloud storage account and give your employees access to it. Then, challenge them to create the best resume they can. The sky is the limit!"
