HiTechMadeEz is a website I created that will provide a variety of resources to people and help educate friends and family members about using technology. 

I have changed my mind several times on how I want to approach this goal of education and whom is my audience. At first, I used AWS did a full-scale backend. Route 53 as my DNS, load balancer, EC2 LAMP stack then AMI image of Plesk, CloudFront, S3. This allowed me to fulfill these Roles

**First Role**  
Since WordPress is still the number one website platform used. I wanted to keep my knowledge current on WordPress. To be able answer any questions that my friends or family may have, the other reason was to keep updated on management, security, varies integrations.  
**Second Role** No longer current see update below
hosting.hitechmadeez.com you will see that is Plesk login. I am running the Plesk application on EC2 AMI Image. This provides an easy-to-use GUI for I and my friends that are hosting their websites with me.  
**Third Role**  
While I am still in AWS 12-month free tier, I can explore and use several AWS services that I would not normally use and put them into practice while trying to stay within a set budget. This will also allow me to work within the AWS Budget explorer and, see how the cost are applied across all the services. I have setup budget and alerts in place to notify me at certain thresholds are met, my average spending is around $100 US for all the services and subscriptions required to provide reliable hosting environment. I have found this very useful in understanding how the services work and what benefits they bring along with the cost.  
  
**UPDATE 24 Sept 2022**  
After reviewing finances (Moving back to US and the soaring cost) and looking at the time commitment to offer a feature rich but demanding production web hosting environment, the response time (SLA) if anyone had any sort of problems and working a full-time job.
I decided to move almost everything to a shared hosting provider. All that is left right now on AWS is S3 containers, this resume site running on S3 and CloudWatch, CloudFront. I learned a lot but in the end time and money forced me to move everything. 
I am revamping HiTechMadeEZ as I am writing this update ,once I have the site out of development I will append this.
