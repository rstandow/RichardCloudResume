HiTechMadeEz is a website I created that will provide a variety of resources to help people educate their friends and family members about technology. The website has several articles, videos, and other resources that can 
be used to educate others about various topics related to technology. The website will also have several forums where people can ask questions and get help from others who are more knowledgeable about technology. 
HiTechMadeEz is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about technology or educate others about it.  

I have gone back and forth if I want to monetize it or not. Right now, to be honest it is a little bit all over the place and plan on making it just Information site to help others. I also plan on getting a few other friends to 
help with article generation. As of right now though it is serving a couple different roles  

**First Role**  
Since WordPress is still the number one website platform used. I wanted to use it answer questions that my friends always have, the other is keep updated on management, security, varies integrations using it.  
**Second Role**  
If you go to hosting.hitechmadeez.com you will see that is Plesk login. I am running the Plesk application on EC2 AMI Image. This provides an easy-to-use GUI for I and my friends that are hosting their websites with me.  
**Third Role**  
While I am still in AWS 12-month free tier, explore and use AWS services and put them into practice. This does not mean everything is free for me, but I try my best to keep the cost down. I can also see for myself how to
explore AWS Budget explorer, see how the cost are applied. I have a budget setup and alerts in place, I average around $100 US. Always looking how to maximize resources to minimalize cost. I have found this very useful 
in understanding how the services work and what benefits they bring.  
  
**UPDATE 24 Sept 2022**  
After revieving finaces(Moving back to US and soaring cost) and looking at comitment feature rich but demanding Production web hosting eveiorment. The time required and honesty response time if anyone had any sort of peoblems.
I have moved almost everything to Hosted provider.All that is left is S3 containers , this resume site running on S3 and cloudwatch. I learned alot but in the end time and money forced me to move everything. I learned alot and will use AWS for small or personal projects.
I am revamping HiTechMadeEZ once it is updated I will change this.
